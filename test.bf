Take user input thrice and print the result (A really simple example to just get you started with all the operations, feel free to mess with it as much you want! ) 

(Note: depending on your terminal, you may get asked to input a 4th time but with no prints before exiting; this can be easily avoided if you directly pipe the input into the program to avoid any buffering or extra space being taken for a single iteration;)
